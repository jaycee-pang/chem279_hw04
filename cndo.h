General algorithm
1. Guess initial P 
2. Build Fock matrix with guessed P 
        - need function to input a guessed/temp P 
        - have Fock matrix otherwise set up 
            ie. calculate gamma, have I and A
3. Solve eigenvalue problems to update MO coefficients and eigenvalues 
    (for alpha and beta): FC = CE 
4. Make new density matrices P = CC.T 
    occupy p and q lowest energy MOs for alpha and beta 
5. Compare new density matrices, converged to some threshold? 
    arma::aprox_equal(Pa, Pa_old, "absdiff", tol)
6. If converged, calculate total energy. Else, return to step 2
